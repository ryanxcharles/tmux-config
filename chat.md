using tmux, how do i make a new pane in the current window?

# === ASSISTANT ===

In `tmux`, you can create a new pane in the current window by splitting the
existing pane either horizontally or vertically. Here’s how to do it:

1. **Split Pane Vertically (side by side):**
   - Press `Ctrl + b` (the default prefix key in tmux) and then press `"`
     (double quote).
   - This will split the current pane into two panes stacked vertically.

2. **Split Pane Horizontally (one above the other):**
   - Press `Ctrl + b` (the default prefix key) and then press `%` (percent
     sign).
   - This will split the current pane into two panes side by side.

### Notes:

- After splitting, the new pane will be created, and your cursor will
  automatically move to the new pane.
- You can navigate between panes using `Ctrl + b` followed by the arrow keys (or
  other navigation bindings if configured).
- If you’ve customized your `tmux` prefix key (e.g., to `Ctrl + a`), use that
  instead of `Ctrl + b`.

These commands allow you to organize your terminal workspace efficiently within
a single `tmux` window.

when i open a new window in tmux, it goes to a directory i don't expect. i think
it was a directory where i originally started tmux. however, i have navigated to
a new directory and want new windows to start there. how do i change the default
directory for new windows

# === ASSISTANT ===

In `tmux`, when you create a new window or pane, it often starts in the
directory where the `tmux` session was originally started. However, you can
change the default directory for new windows (and panes) in a few ways. Below
are the steps to achieve this:

### Option 1: Change the Default Directory for New Windows in the Current Session

If you want new windows to start in the current working directory (the directory
you're currently in within the active pane), you can use the `attach-session`
command or configure `tmux` to respect the current directory.

1. **Manually Set the Directory for a New Window:** When creating a new window,
   you can specify the starting directory using the `-c` flag with the
   `new-window` command:

   ```bash
   tmux new-window -c "$(pwd)"
   ```

   This will create a new window starting in the current directory. You can bind
   this to a key for convenience (see below).

2. **Set the Default Directory for the Session Dynamically:** `tmux` doesn't
   automatically update the default directory for new windows based on the
   active pane's directory unless configured. You can update the session's
   default directory by running this command in the desired directory:
   ```bash
   tmux attach-session -t . -c "$(pwd)"
   ```
   This updates the session's working directory to the current one. New windows
   will now start in this directory.

### Option 2: Configure `tmux.conf` to Always Use the Current Pane's Directory

You can configure `tmux` to always create new windows and panes in the directory
of the current pane by adding the following to your `tmux.conf` file (usually
located at `~/.tmux.conf`):

```bash
# Set the default directory for new windows and panes to the current pane's directory
bind c new-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind '"' split-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind % split-window -h -c "#{pane_current_path}"
```

- `bind c`: Rebinds the default key for creating a new window (`Ctrl + b, c`) to
  use the current pane's directory.
- `bind '"'`: Rebinds the vertical split key to use the current pane's
  directory.
- `bind '%'` : Rebinds the horizontal split key to use the current pane's
  directory.

After adding these lines, reload your `tmux` configuration by running:

```bash
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
```

Now, new windows and panes will start in the directory of the pane from which
you issued the command.

### Option 3: Set a Specific Default Directory for All New Windows

If you want all new windows in a session to start in a specific directory (not
necessarily the current one), you can set the `default-path` option for the
session. However, note that `default-path` is deprecated in newer versions of
`tmux`, and the `-c` flag or the above `pane_current_path` method is preferred.
If you still want to use it (in older versions), you can set it like this:

```bash
tmux set-option default-path "/path/to/directory"
```

### Option 4: Start a New Session with a Specific Directory

If you're starting a new `tmux` session, you can specify the starting directory
with the `-c` flag:

```bash
tmux new-session -c "/path/to/directory"
```

This sets the initial directory for the session, and new windows will inherit it
unless overridden.

### Summary

- For a quick fix in the current session, use `tmux new-window -c "$(pwd)"` or
  update the session's directory with `attach-session`.
- For a permanent solution, update your `~/.tmux.conf` with bindings to use
  `#{pane_current_path}` as shown in Option 2. This is the most flexible and
  recommended approach for modern `tmux` versions.

If you’re using a recent version of `tmux`, the `pane_current_path` method in
`tmux.conf` will ensure that new windows and panes always start in the directory
of the current pane, matching your expected behavior.

# === USER ===

once i load several windows, is there a way to move them? i want to move the
current window one to the left.

# === ASSISTANT ===

Yes, in `tmux`, you can reorder or move windows within a session to change their
position (e.g., move the current window one position to the left). This is done
using the `move-window` or `swap-window` commands. Here's how you can achieve
this:

### Move the Current Window One Position to the Left

To move the current window one position to the left (i.e., decrease its index by
1), you can use the `swap-window` command to swap it with the window at the
lower index.

1. **Using the Command Mode:**
   - Press `Ctrl + b` (or your custom prefix key) and then type `:` to enter
     command mode.
   - Enter the following command to swap the current window with the one to its
     left (assuming the window indices are sequential):
     ```
     swap-window -t -1
     ```
   - Press `Enter`. This moves the current window one position to the left by
     swapping it with the window at the previous index.

   **Explanation**: The `-t -1` specifies the target as the window with an index
   one less than the current window's index.

2. **Binding a Key to Move Window Left (Optional):** If you want to make this a
   quick operation, you can bind a key to perform this action by adding the
   following to your `~/.tmux.conf`:
   ```bash
   bind-key Left swap-window -t -1
   ```
   After reloading your configuration (`tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf`), you can
   press `Ctrl + b, Left` (or your prefix + Left) to move the current window one
   position to the left.

### Move the Current Window to a Specific Position

If you want to move the current window to a specific index (not necessarily just
one to the left), you can use the `move-window` command:

1. **Using the Command Mode:**
   - Press `Ctrl + b` and then `:` to enter command mode.
   - Enter the following command to move the current window to a specific index
     (e.g., index 2):
     ```
     move-window -t 2
     ```
   - Press `Enter`. This will move the current window to index 2, shifting other
     windows as needed.

   **Note**: If a window already exists at the target index, `move-window` will
   renumber the windows to accommodate the move, unlike `swap-window` which
   exchanges positions.

2. **Binding a Key to Move to a Specific Index (Optional):** You can also bind
   keys to move windows to specific positions if needed, though this is less
   common.

### Additional Notes

- **Window Indices**: `tmux` window indices start at 0 by default (unless you've
  changed `base-index` in your configuration). Moving a window to the left means
  swapping it with the window at a lower index.
- **Swap vs. Move**: Use `swap-window` to exchange positions with another window
  (like moving left or right by one), and `move-window` to place the window at a
  specific index, potentially renumbering others.
- **Directionality**: If you want to move the window one to the right, you can
  use `swap-window -t +1` in a similar manner.
- **Check Window Indices**: To see the current window indices, press
  `Ctrl + b, w` to bring up the window list, or look at the status bar if it
  displays window numbers.

### Example Key Bindings for Moving Left and Right

To make moving windows left and right easier, add these to your `~/.tmux.conf`:

```bash
bind-key Left swap-window -t -1
bind-key Right swap-window -t +1
```

After reloading (`tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf`), you can use `Ctrl + b, Left`
to move the current window left and `Ctrl + b, Right` to move it right.

This should give you full control over reordering your `tmux` windows! Let me
know if you have further questions.

# === USER ===

this isn't quite right. these commands will move the current window left or
right, but it won't move to the new window location. instead, it stays on the
current window location, which is now out of date, because it has been swapped.
can i update these commands to move the current window left or right, and then
also pivot left or right to move with the window?

# === ASSISTANT ===

You're absolutely right—when you use `swap-window` in `tmux`, it reorders the
windows but doesn't automatically move your focus to the new position of the
window you just swapped. The focus stays on the original window index, which can
be confusing since the content has changed due to the swap. To address this, you
can combine the `swap-window` command with a `select-window` command to follow
the window to its new position.

Below, I'll explain how to update the commands and key bindings to move the
current window left or right and simultaneously shift focus to the new position
of that window.

### Understanding the Issue and Solution

- When you run `swap-window -t -1`, the current window swaps with the one to its
  left (lower index), but your focus remains on the original index, which now
  contains the other window's content.
- To fix this, after swapping, we need to explicitly move focus to the new index
  of the original window. Since `swap-window -t -1` moves the current window to
  a lower index, we need to select the window at `-1` relative to the current
  index after the swap.
- Similarly, for moving right (`swap-window -t +1`), we need to select the
  window at `+1` after the swap.

### Updated Commands to Move and Follow the Window

You can chain commands in `tmux` using `;` to execute multiple actions in
sequence. Here are the updated commands to move the current window left or right
and follow it:

1. **Move Current Window One Position to the Left and Follow:**
   - Enter command mode with `Ctrl + b, :` (or your prefix).
   - Run:
     ```
     swap-window -t -1 ; select-window -t -1
     ```
   - This swaps the current window with the one to its left and then moves focus
     to the new position (one index lower).

2. **Move Current Window One Position to the Right and Follow:**
   - Enter command mode with `Ctrl + b, :`.
   - Run:
     ```
     swap-window -t +1 ; select-window -t +1
     ```
   - This swaps the current window with the one to its right and then moves
     focus to the new position (one index higher).

### Binding Keys to Move and Follow

To make this seamless, you can bind keys to perform both the swap and the focus
shift in one action by adding the following to your `~/.tmux.conf`:

```bash
# Move current window to the left and follow it
bind-key Left swap-window -t -1 \; select-window -t -1

# Move current window to the right and follow it
bind-key Right swap-window -t +1 \; select-window -t +1
```

- **Explanation**: The `\;` is used in the configuration file to separate
  multiple `tmux` commands (since `;` alone would be interpreted by the shell).
  This ensures that after swapping, the focus moves to the new window position.
- After adding these bindings, reload your configuration with:
  ```bash
  tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
  ```
- Now, pressing `Ctrl + b, Left` will move the current window one position to
  the left and shift focus to it. Similarly, `Ctrl + b, Right` will move it one
  position to the right and follow it.

### Edge Cases and Notes

- **First Window (Index 0)**: If you're on the leftmost window (index 0) and try
  to move left, `tmux` will not perform the swap (since there's no window at
  index -1), and you'll stay in place. This is the default behavior and prevents
  errors.
- **Last Window**: Similarly, if you're on the rightmost window and try to move
  right, `tmux` won't swap (no higher index exists), and focus won't change.
- **Custom Prefix**: If you've changed your `tmux` prefix (e.g., to `Ctrl + a`),
  use that instead of `Ctrl + b` when invoking the key bindings.
- **Alternative Keys**: If `Left` and `Right` conflict with other bindings or
  aren't convenient, you can use other keys (e.g., `bind-key H` for left and
  `bind-key L` for right).

### Testing the Behavior

After applying the bindings:

1. Open multiple windows in `tmux` (e.g., with `Ctrl + b, c`).
2. Check the window indices in the status bar or with `Ctrl + b, w`.
3. Use `Ctrl + b, Left` to move the current window left and confirm that focus
   follows to the new position.
4. Use `Ctrl + b, Right` to move it right and confirm the focus shift.

This updated approach ensures that when you reorder windows, your focus travels
with the window you moved, providing a more intuitive experience. Let me know if
you encounter any issues or want to tweak the behavior further!

# === USER ===

i have a weird problem with this config:

```tmux
# Set the default directory for new windows and panes to the current pane's directory
bind c new-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind '"' split-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind % split-window -h -c "#{pane_current_path}"

# Bind a key to open a new pane on the right with width 120
bind-key l split-window -h -l 120
```

the bind key on "l" opens a window as desired, but it doesn't seem to follow the
rule on the lines previous that say it should go to the directory of the current
pane. instead, it seems to open up in another directory, which is the directory
of another window entirely. any idea why or how to fix?

# === ASSISTANT ===

You're encountering a behavior in `tmux` where the custom key binding for
splitting a window (`bind-key l split-window -h -l 120`) does not inherit the
default directory behavior specified in the earlier bindings
(`-c "#{pane_current_path}"`). This happens because the `split-window` command
in your custom binding for `l` does not explicitly include the
`-c "#{pane_current_path}"` option, so `tmux` falls back to its default behavior
for the starting directory of new panes, which is often the directory of the
session or the directory where the session was started (or sometimes influenced
by the directory of another window or pane).

Let’s break down why this happens and how to fix it.

### Why This Happens

- In your configuration, the bindings for `"` and `%` explicitly include the
  `-c "#{pane_current_path}"` option, which tells `tmux` to start the new pane
  in the directory of the current pane.
- However, your custom binding for `l` (`split-window -h -l 120`) does not
  include the `-c` option. Without this, `tmux` uses the session's default
  directory or the directory associated with the window (which might be
  inherited from where the session or window was created, or from another
  pane/window in some cases).
- This discrepancy causes the new pane opened with `Ctrl + b, l` to start in an
  unexpected directory, likely the session's initial directory or the directory
  of another window.

### How to Fix It

To ensure that the new pane created with `Ctrl + b, l` starts in the directory
of the current pane, you need to add the `-c "#{pane_current_path}"` option to
your custom binding for `l`. Update your `~/.tmux.conf` as follows:

```tmux
# Set the default directory for new windows and panes to the current pane's directory
bind c new-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind '"' split-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind % split-window -h -c "#{pane_current_path}"

# Bind a key to open a new pane on the right with width 120, starting in the current pane's directory
bind-key l split-window -h -l 120 -c "#{pane_current_path}"
```

### Explanation of the Fix

- By adding `-c "#{pane_current_path}"` to the `split-window` command in the
  `bind-key l` line, you explicitly instruct `tmux` to start the new pane in the
  directory of the current pane, just like the other bindings.
- The `-h` flag specifies a horizontal split (pane on the right), and `-l 120`
  sets the width of the new pane to 120 columns. The `-c` option works alongside
  these without conflict.

### Steps to Apply and Test

1. Update your `~/.tmux.conf` with the modified binding as shown above.
2. Reload your `tmux` configuration by running:
   ```bash
   tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
   ```
3. Test the behavior by navigating to a specific directory in a pane, then
   pressing `Ctrl + b, l` to open a new pane. Verify that the new pane starts in
   the same directory as the current pane (you can check with `pwd`).

### Additional Notes

- **Session Default Directory**: If the new pane still opens in an unexpected
  directory, double-check if the session's default directory has been altered
  (e.g., via `attach-session -c` or a misconfiguration). You can inspect the
  session's directory with `tmux show-options | grep default-path` (if using an
  older `tmux` version) or by checking the behavior of new windows/panes without
  custom bindings.
- **Order of Options**: The order of options in `split-window` (like `-h`,
  `-l 120`, `-c "#{pane_current_path}"`) doesn’t matter; `tmux` will parse them
  correctly as long as they’re valid.
- **Custom Prefix**: If you’ve changed your prefix key, use that instead of
  `Ctrl + b` when testing the binding.
- **Debugging Directory**: If the issue persists, you can debug by creating a
  new pane with `Ctrl + b, l` and running `pwd` in the new pane to see where
  it’s starting. Compare this with the directory of the original pane to confirm
  the behavior.

### Why It Might Have Picked Another Window’s Directory

Without the `-c` option, `tmux` might default to the directory associated with
the window or session. If a window was created in a different directory (or if
the session's starting directory was set elsewhere), new panes might inherit
that directory instead of the current pane’s directory. Explicitly setting
`-c "#{pane_current_path}"` overrides this and ensures consistency.

This updated configuration should resolve the issue, ensuring that your new pane
opened with `Ctrl + b, l` starts in the current pane’s directory. Let me know if
you run into any further issues or need additional clarification!

# === USER ===

in tmux, my pane ... crashed. how do i reopen the pane and re-navigate to the
same directory?

# === ASSISTANT ===

In `tmux`, if a pane "crashes" (e.g., the shell or process running in the pane
exits or terminates unexpectedly), the pane itself doesn't disappear—it remains
in the layout, but the process inside it (like your shell) is gone. You can
restart a shell or process in that pane and navigate back to the same directory
if you know where it was. However, `tmux` does not automatically store the
working directory of a pane once the process exits, so you might need to
manually navigate to the directory or use some workarounds to recover it.

Below, I'll explain how to reopen or restart a process in the pane and how to
navigate to the same directory, including potential ways to recover the
directory if it’s not immediately obvious.

### Step 1: Restart the Pane (Respawn a Shell)

If the pane's process has crashed or exited, you can start a new shell or
process in that pane using the `respawn-pane` command. Here's how:

1. **Select the Pane**: If the crashed pane isn’t already selected, navigate to
   it using `Ctrl + b` followed by the arrow keys (or your configured navigation
   keys).
2. **Respawn a Shell in the Pane**:
   - Enter command mode by pressing `Ctrl + b, :` (or your custom prefix).
   - Type the following command and press `Enter`:
     ```
     respawn-pane
     ```
   - This will restart the default shell (or the shell specified in your `tmux`
     configuration) in the selected pane.

   **Note**: If you want to specify a specific shell or command, you can use:

   ```
   respawn-pane -c /path/to/directory bash
   ```

   Replace `bash` with your preferred shell (e.g., `zsh`, `fish`) and
   `/path/to/directory` with the desired starting directory if you know it (see
   Step 2).

### Step 2: Navigate to the Same Directory

Unfortunately, once the process in a pane exits, `tmux` does not retain the
working directory of that pane in memory for automatic recovery. However, there
are a few approaches to get back to the same directory:

#### Approach 1: Check If the Directory Is Still Accessible

- If you remember the directory or if it’s still in your shell history (from
  before the crash), you can manually navigate to it after respawning the pane.
- After running `respawn-pane`, type `pwd` to see where the new shell started.
  If it’s not the desired directory, use `cd` to navigate to the correct one if
  you know it.

#### Approach 2: Use `tmux` Pane History (If Applicable)

- If the pane’s process crashed but didn’t clear the terminal output (e.g., you
  can still see the last prompt or output), scroll up in the pane’s history to
  check the last known directory.
  - Enter copy mode with `Ctrl + b, [` (or your custom key).
  - Scroll up using arrow keys or `Page Up`/`Page Down` to look for a `pwd`
    output or a prompt that shows the directory path.
  - Exit copy mode with `q` or `Esc`.
  - Once you identify the directory, navigate to it with
    `cd /path/to/directory`.

#### Approach 3: Leverage `tmux` Configuration for Current Path

If your `tmux.conf` is configured to start new panes in the directory of the
current pane (as discussed in previous responses), and if another pane in the
same window or session is still in the desired directory, you can rely on that:

- Check other panes in the same window or session by navigating to them
  (`Ctrl + b, arrow keys`).
- Run `pwd` in those panes to see if any are still in the directory you want.
- If you find the directory, note it and navigate back to the crashed pane, then
  use `cd /path/to/directory`.
- Alternatively, if your `tmux.conf` includes bindings like
  `split-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"`, you can create a temporary new pane
  from a pane in the correct directory, then close it after noting the path.

#### Approach 4: Recover Directory from Shell History (If Available)

If the crashed pane’s shell history is preserved in your shell configuration
(e.g., `~/.bash_history` for Bash or `~/.zsh_history` for Zsh), you might be
able to find the last `cd` command or directory:

- After respawning the pane, check your shell history by pressing `Up` arrow or
  using `history | grep cd` to look for recent `cd` commands.
- If you find the directory, navigate to it with `cd /path/to/directory`.

#### Approach 5: Prevent Future Issues by Logging Directories

Since `tmux` doesn’t natively track pane directories after a crash, you can
proactively log the working directory of panes to recover it later. For example:

- Before a process might crash, run `pwd > ~/last_directory.txt` in the pane to
  save the current directory to a file.
- After respawning, check the file with `cat ~/last_directory.txt` and navigate
  to it with `cd $(cat ~/last_directory.txt)`.

Alternatively, you can use a `tmux` plugin or script to track pane directories,
but this requires setup (e.g., `tmux-resurrect` with custom extensions).

### Step 3: Automate Directory Recovery with `tmux.conf` (Optional)

If you frequently deal with pane crashes and want new shells to start in a
predictable directory, ensure your `tmux.conf` is set up to respawn panes in the
directory of the current pane or window (as discussed earlier). Update or verify
the following in `~/.tmux.conf`:

```tmux
# Ensure new panes and windows start in the current pane's directory
bind c new-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind '"' split-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind % split-window -h -c "#{pane_current_path}"
```

Unfortunately, `respawn-pane` doesn’t directly support
`-c "#{pane_current_path}"` in a binding by default for crashed panes since the
original pane’s path isn’t retained post-crash. However, if you respawn
manually, you can specify a directory as shown above.

### Additional Notes

- **Preventing Crashes**: If panes are crashing due to a specific command or
  script, consider running it in a way that logs output (e.g.,
  `command 2>&1 | tee log.txt`) so you can debug the cause and retain context
  like the directory.
- **tmux-resurrect Plugin**: If this is a recurring issue, consider using the
  `tmux-resurrect` plugin, which can save and restore `tmux` sessions, including
  pane layouts and sometimes working directories (with additional
  configuration). Install it via the `tmux` plugin manager (TPM) and configure
  it to save directories.
- **Check Session Directory**: If the respawned pane starts in an unexpected
  directory, it might be inheriting the session’s default directory. You can
  check or update it with:
  ```bash
  tmux show-options | grep default-path
  ```
  Or update the session directory with:
  ```bash
  tmux attach-session -t . -c /path/to/desired/directory
  ```

### Summary

1. Use `respawn-pane` via `Ctrl + b, : respawn-pane` to restart a shell in the
   crashed pane.
2. Navigate to the directory manually if you remember it, or recover it from
   terminal history, other panes, or shell history.
3. Consider proactive measures like logging directories or using plugins like
   `tmux-resurrect` for future recovery.

If you don’t recall the directory and can’t recover it from history or other
panes, you may need to manually navigate based on memory or project context. Let
me know if you need help setting up a plugin or scripting a more automated
solution!

# === USER ===

in tmux, isn't there a way to enter some mode where i can scroll up through the
terminal history? and select stuff? and copy it? how do i do that?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Yes, in `tmux`, you can enter a mode called **Copy Mode** (also referred to as
Scroll Mode) that allows you to scroll through the terminal history of a pane,
select text, and copy it to the `tmux` clipboard (and often to your system
clipboard, depending on your configuration). This is incredibly useful for
reviewing past output or copying commands and text from the terminal history.

Below, I'll explain how to enter Copy Mode, navigate the history, select text,
and copy it, as well as some related configuration options.

### Entering Copy Mode

To enter Copy Mode in `tmux`, use the following keybinding:

- Press `Ctrl + b, [` (or your custom prefix followed by `[`).
  - This switches the current pane into Copy Mode, allowing you to scroll
    through the history.

Once in Copy Mode, the terminal output becomes scrollable, and you’ll see a
highlight or cursor indicating your position in the history (depending on your
`tmux` version and configuration).

### Navigating in Copy Mode

While in Copy Mode, you can navigate through the terminal history using the
following default keybindings (these mimic `vi` keybindings by default, but can
be configured to use `emacs` style if preferred):

- **Scroll Up**: Press `Up Arrow`, `k`, or `Ctrl + p` to move up one line.
- **Scroll Down**: Press `Down Arrow`, `j`, or `Ctrl + n` to move down one line.
- **Page Up**: Press `Page Up` or `Ctrl + b` to move up one page.
- **Page Down**: Press `Page Down` or `Ctrl + f` to move down one page.
- **Top of History**: Press `g` to jump to the top of the history.
- **Bottom of History**: Press `G` (capital G) to jump to the bottom (most
  recent output).
- **Line Navigation**: Press `:` followed by a line number and `Enter` to jump
  to a specific line (e.g., `:50` to go to line 50).

### Selecting Text in Copy Mode

To select text for copying:

1. Move the cursor to the starting point of the text you want to select using
   the navigation keys.
2. Start the selection:
   - Press `Space` to begin selecting text (this is the default in `vi` mode).
   - Alternatively, if you’re using `emacs` mode (see configuration below),
     press `Ctrl + Space`.
3. Move the cursor (using arrow keys or other navigation keys) to highlight the
   desired text. The selection will be visually highlighted.
4. Copy the selected text to the `tmux` clipboard:
   - Press `Enter` (in `vi` mode) to copy the selection and exit Copy Mode.
   - In `emacs` mode, press `Alt + w` or `Ctrl + w` to copy.

### Pasting Text from the `tmux` Clipboard

Once you’ve copied text to the `tmux` clipboard, you can paste it into a pane:

- Press `Ctrl + b, ]` (or your custom prefix followed by `]`).
- This will paste the contents of the `tmux` clipboard at the cursor position in
  the active pane.

### Copying to System Clipboard (Optional Configuration)

By default, copying text in `tmux` Copy Mode only stores it in the `tmux`
clipboard, not your system clipboard. To copy to the system clipboard, you need
to configure `tmux` to interact with your system’s clipboard tool (e.g.,
`xclip` or `xsel` on Linux, `pbcopy` on macOS, or `clip.exe` on Windows WSL).
Here’s how to set it up:

1. **Install a Clipboard Tool (if needed):**
   - On Linux, install `xclip` or `xsel` (e.g., `sudo apt install xclip` on
     Debian/Ubuntu).
   - On macOS, `pbcopy` is built-in.
   - On Windows (WSL), `clip.exe` is usually available.

2. **Update `tmux.conf` to Bind Copy to System Clipboard:**
   Add the following to your `~/.tmux.conf` to automatically send copied text to
   the system clipboard (example for Linux with `xclip`):

   ```tmux
   # Use vi mode for copy mode
   set-window-option -g mode-keys vi

   # Bind 'Enter' in copy mode to copy to system clipboard (Linux with xclip)
   bind-key -T copy-mode-vi Enter send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel "xclip -selection clipboard"
   ```

   - For macOS (with `pbcopy`):
     ```tmux
     bind-key -T copy-mode-vi Enter send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel "pbcopy"
     ```

   - For Windows (WSL with `clip.exe`):
     ```tmux
     bind-key -T copy-mode-vi Enter send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel "clip.exe"
     ```

3. Reload your configuration:
   ```bash
   tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
   ```

4. Now, when you select text and press `Enter` in Copy Mode, it will be copied
   to your system clipboard and can be pasted outside of `tmux` (e.g., with
   `Ctrl + v`).

### Switching Between `vi` and `emacs` Keybindings

By default, `tmux` uses `vi` keybindings in Copy Mode. If you prefer `emacs`
style, add this to your `~/.tmux.conf`:

```tmux
set-window-option -g mode-keys emacs
```

- In `emacs` mode, start selecting with `Ctrl + Space`, and copy with `Alt + w`.
- Reload the configuration with `tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf`.

### Exiting Copy Mode

To exit Copy Mode without copying anything:

- Press `q` or `Esc`.

This will return you to the normal `tmux` mode with the pane focused on the
latest output.

### Additional Notes

- **History Limit**: The amount of history you can scroll through depends on the
  `history-limit` setting in `tmux`. By default, it’s 2000 lines, but you can
  increase it in `~/.tmux.conf`:
  ```tmux
  set-option -g history-limit 50000
  ```
  Reload with `tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf`. Note that a larger history limit
  consumes more memory.
- **Mouse Support**: If you enable mouse support in `tmux`, you can scroll and
  select text with the mouse. Add this to `~/.tmux.conf`:
  ```tmux
  set-option -g mouse on
  ```
  After reloading, you can scroll with the mouse wheel and select text by
  clicking and dragging (though copying might still require keyboard commands
  unless further configured).
- **Search in Copy Mode**: While in Copy Mode, press `?` (in `vi` mode) or
  `Ctrl + s` (in `emacs` mode) to search backward, or `/` (in `vi` mode) to
  search forward. Type your search term and press `Enter`. Use `n` to jump to
  the next match and `N` for the previous.
- **Custom Keybindings**: You can customize Copy Mode keybindings in
  `~/.tmux.conf` if the defaults don’t suit you. For example, to bind a
  different key for entering Copy Mode:
  ```tmux
  bind-key s copy-mode
  ```

### Summary of Default Keybindings (vi Mode)

- Enter Copy Mode: `Ctrl + b, [`
- Scroll: `Up`/`Down`, `k`/`j`, `Page Up`/`Page Down`
- Select Text: `Space` to start, move cursor to highlight, `Enter` to copy
- Paste: `Ctrl + b, ]`
- Exit Copy Mode: `q` or `Esc`

This should give you full control over scrolling through history, selecting, and
copying text in `tmux`. If you have issues with the system clipboard
integration or want to customize the behavior further, let me know!

instead of enter, can i bind ""+y", which is what i'm used to doing in neovim?

```tmux
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi Enter send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel "pbcopy"
```

# === ASSISTANT ===

Yes, you can absolutely bind `"+y` (or more precisely, `"` followed by `+`
and then `y`) in `tmux` Copy Mode to mimic the behavior you're used to in
Neovim, where `"+y` yanks (copies) to the system clipboard. In `tmux`, you can
customize keybindings in Copy Mode to achieve this by binding a sequence or a
specific key to copy the selected text to the system clipboard (using `pbcopy`
on macOS, as in your example, or another clipboard tool on other systems).

However, binding a multi-key sequence like `"+y` directly in `tmux` isn't
natively supported as a single binding because `tmux` keybindings typically
operate on single keys or simple combinations, not multi-character sequences with
quotes. Instead, you can bind a single key or a simpler combination to perform
the copy action, or approximate the Neovim behavior by binding `y` in Copy Mode
to copy to the system clipboard.

Below, I'll show you how to bind `y` in Copy Mode to copy the selected text to
the system clipboard (using `pbcopy` for macOS as in your snippet), which is the
closest and most practical way to mimic the `y` part of `"+y` from Neovim. If
you specifically want the `"+` prefix, I'll explain the limitations and a
possible workaround.

### Binding `y` in Copy Mode to Copy to System Clipboard

Since you're used to `y` for yanking in Neovim, let's bind `y` in `tmux` Copy
Mode to copy the selected text and send it to the system clipboard. Add the
following to your `~/.tmux.conf`:

```tmux
# Use vi mode for copy mode
set-window-option -g mode-keys vi

# Bind 'y' in copy mode to copy selection to system clipboard (macOS with pbcopy)
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi y send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel "pbcopy"
```

### Explanation

- `set-window-option -g mode-keys vi`: Ensures Copy Mode uses `vi`-style
  keybindings, which aligns with Neovim's default behavior and makes `y` a
  natural choice for yanking.
- `bind-key -T copy-mode-vi y`: Binds the `y` key in Copy Mode (`copy-mode-vi`
  table) to perform the copy action.
- `send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel "pbcopy"`: Copies the selected text to the
  `tmux` clipboard and pipes it to `pbcopy`, which sends it to the macOS system
  clipboard. The `-cancel` part exits Copy Mode after copying, mimicking the
  behavior of `Enter` in the default setup.

### Steps to Apply

1. Add the above lines to your `~/.tmux.conf`.
2. Reload your `tmux` configuration:
   ```bash
   tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
   ```
3. Test it:
   - Enter Copy Mode with `Ctrl + b, [`.
   - Navigate to the text you want to copy using arrow keys or `vi` motions
     (`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`, etc.).
   - Start selecting text with `Space`.
   - Move the cursor to highlight the desired text.
   - Press `y` to copy the selection to the system clipboard and exit Copy Mode.
   - Paste outside `tmux` with `Cmd + v` (on macOS) to confirm it worked.

### Limitations of Binding `"+y`

`tmux` does not natively support binding multi-key sequences like `"+y` as a
single action because its keybinding system is designed for single keys or
prefix-modified keys (e.g., `Ctrl + key`). The `"` and `+` characters are not
interpreted as part of a sequence in the same way Neovim handles them for
register selection.

- In Neovim, `"+y` means "yank to the `+` register (system clipboard)," and the
  `"` initiates a register selection followed by `+` to specify the clipboard
  register.
- In `tmux`, there’s no direct concept of "registers" like in Vim/Neovim, so
  `"+` doesn’t have a special meaning, and binding a sequence like this isn’t
  straightforward.

### Workaround for Approximating `"+y`

If you really want to use a sequence similar to `"+y`, you can bind a simpler
key combination (like `+` or a leader key followed by `y`) in Copy Mode to
perform the copy-to-clipboard action. For example, bind `+` to copy to the
system clipboard:

```tmux
# Bind '+' in copy mode to copy selection to system clipboard (macOS with pbcopy)
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi + send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel "pbcopy"
```

Now, in Copy Mode, after selecting text with `Space`, you can press `+` to copy
to the system clipboard. It’s not exactly `"+y`, but it incorporates the `+` as
a nod to the clipboard register in Neovim.

Alternatively, if you want a two-key sequence, you could use a custom prefix
within Copy Mode, but this requires more complex scripting or plugins and isn’t
as seamless.

### Additional Notes

- **Clipboard Tool**: If you’re not on macOS, replace `pbcopy` with the
  appropriate tool for your system:
  - Linux: `xclip -selection clipboard` or `xsel --clipboard --input`
  - Windows (WSL): `clip.exe`
- **Default Behavior**: If you previously had `Enter` bound to copy (as in your
  snippet), adding the `y` binding won’t conflict with it—you can use either.
  If you want to unbind `Enter`, you can explicitly rebind it or leave it as is.
- **Neovim Integration**: If you use `tmux` with Neovim and want clipboard
  integration between them, ensure Neovim is configured to access the system
  clipboard (e.g., with `set clipboard=unnamedplus` in your Neovim config) and
  that `tmux` is set up to pipe to the same clipboard as shown above.
- **Conflict Check**: If `y` or `+` is already bound to something else in your
  `tmux` configuration, check with `tmux list-keys -T copy-mode-vi` to see
  current bindings in Copy Mode.

### Summary

Binding `y` in Copy Mode to copy to the system clipboard is the closest and most
practical way to mimic Neovim’s yanking behavior. Add
`bind-key -T copy-mode-vi y send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel "pbcopy"` to your
`~/.tmux.conf`, reload it, and you’ll be able to copy with `y` after selecting
text. While `"+y` as a literal sequence isn’t directly supported, binding `y` or
`+` achieves the desired functionality.

Let me know if you’d like to explore a more complex workaround for multi-key
sequences or if you have any other customizations in mind!
